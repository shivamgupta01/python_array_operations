# Array Operations

```array.py``` file shows various array operations performed on list in python.

Python by default do not hava array data structure. The data structure present in python is ```list```.

## How Array in python is different from other languages such as  ```Java```.

        1. The List is not defined with number of items inside it. In other languages the ArrayList is defined with the maximum number of itmes in the ArrayList.
        2. Since List has no memory boundations while initializing, it can store more than 1 types of Data Structure inside it.
        3.There are various operations we can perform on the list to solve various problems withput writting complex logic.

## Time Complexity of insert, delete, search and update operations in Python.

```insert```

```
To insert a element at the end of the List the time Complexity is o(1)
To insert a element at starting or middle of the List the time Complexity is o(n).
```

```delete```

```
To delete a element at the end of the List the time Complexity is o(1)
To delete a element at starting or middle of the List the time Complexity is o(n).
```

```search```

```
Searching a list in python is completed on o(n).
Searching with index is completed in constant time o(1).  
```

```update```

```
Updatingan item is completed in constant time O(1)
